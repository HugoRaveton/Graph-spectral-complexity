# Graph-spectral-complexity
Notebook illustrating graph spectral complexity and applications to real networks. 
I recapitulate the results from "A graph complexity measure based on the spectral analysis of the Laplace" 2021 with extra illustrations. I then apply their method to a few real networks from Uri Alon's online resource https://www.weizmann.ac.il/mcb/UriAlon/download/collection-complex-networks
