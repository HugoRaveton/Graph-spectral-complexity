Notebook illustrating graph spectral complexity and applications to real networks. I recapitulate the results from "A graph complexity measure based on the spectral analysis of the Laplace operator", (Diego M. Mateos, Federico Morana, Hugo Aimar, 2021). I then apply their method to a few real networks from Uri Alon's online resource https://www.weizmann.ac.il/mcb/UriAlon/download/collection-complex-networks. Graphs are imported as .txt for analysis and .graphml for visualization in Gephi.
